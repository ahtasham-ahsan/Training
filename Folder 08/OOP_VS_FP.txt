Composition vs Inheritance 


OOP Strengths
Intuitive for real-world modeling.
Encourages encapsulation, making systems modular.
Polymorphism supports dynamic behavior in a hierarchy.
OOP Weaknesses
Tight coupling through inheritance can make systems rigid.
Shared mutable state can lead to bugs and side effects.
Overengineering through excessive abstraction.
FP Strengths
Predictable and bug-free code due to immutability and pure functions.
Functions are reusable and composable.
Works well with parallelism and concurrency.
FP Weaknesses
Immutability can lead to performance overhead due to frequent copying of data.
Abstract concepts like closures, currying, and monads can be hard to grasp.
Debugging can be challenging in heavily composed functional pipelines.
