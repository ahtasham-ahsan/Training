Benifits of Type Script 
- Static Typing
- Code Completion
- Refactoring
- ShortHand Notation

Type Script - Static Typed Language (Static type Language know before the runtime the type of the variable. Dynamic Typed Languages like python donot know about it on the compilation time).

for example - Dynamic Typed 
let a= 10;
a = 'type changed'

Static Typed
let a: number = 10;
a= 'not allowed to change the type


Drawbacks:
- Transpilation 
        We have to give our code to the type Script compiler that converts our ts code to javascript code

- Discipline in Code


Compilation of Code
- command: tsc file.ts

Create Configrations 
- command: tsc --init 

Types in javascript
- Numbers
- Strings
- Boolean 
- Null 
- Undefined
- Objects

- enum
- Tuples


- Type Aliases
- Unions and Intersections
- Type Narrowing
- Nullable Types
- Unknow Type 
- Never Type
